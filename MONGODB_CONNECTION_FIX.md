# MongoDB Connection Fix

This document explains the fix for the MongoDB connection issues in the portfolio application.

## Problem

The application was experiencing issues connecting to MongoDB Atlas, resulting in the following error:

```
Error connecting to MongoDB: No default database defined
```

This error occurred because the MongoDB connection string in the `.env` file didn't specify a database name, and the code was trying to use a default database that didn't exist.

## Solution

The solution involved modifying the `connect_to_mongodb()` function in both the `user_chatbot.py` and `admin_chatbot.py` files to:

1. Always use 'portfolio' as the database name
2. Test the connection with a ping command
3. Improve error handling

### Changes Made

The original code:

```python
def connect_to_mongodb():
    try:
        client = MongoClient(MONGO_URI)
        # Use a specific database name if not specified in the URI
        if '/' in MONGO_URI and MONGO_URI.split('/')[-1]:
            # Database name is in the URI
            db = client.get_database()
        else:
            # Use a default database name
            db = client.portfolio
            
        print(f"Connected to MongoDB: {db.name}")
        return db
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to MongoDB: {e}")
        # Don't exit, just return None
        return None
```

The updated code:

```python
def connect_to_mongodb():
    try:
        client = MongoClient(MONGO_URI)
        
        # Always use 'portfolio' as the database name
        db = client.portfolio
        
        # Test the connection by making a simple query
        db.command('ping')
        
        print(f"Connected to MongoDB: {client.address[0]}")
        return db
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to MongoDB: {e}")
        # Don't exit, just return None
        return None
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: The chatbot now properly reports database connection status to the user
2. **Context Preservation**: Added context tracking to maintain information about database connection status
3. **Improved Dummy Methods**: Updated the dummy methods for when the database is unavailable to use proper parameter naming conventions

## Testing

After implementing these changes, the MongoDB connection is now working correctly. The server logs show:

```
MongoDB Connected: ac-ajxvwny-shard-00-01.vvv45le.mongodb.net
MongoDB connected
```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Database Name in URI**: Consider adding the database name directly in the MongoDB URI in the `.env` file
2. **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling for better performance
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Add a retry mechanism for database operations
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for database connections to detect issues early
